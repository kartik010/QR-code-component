### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

I learned how to center a div and how to use a media query to design for different screen sizes

there are 3 ways to center a div i have used the grid but we more commonly used flexbox and there is also position method of centering

### Continued development

i'm still not comfortable in using position and figuring out the behaviour of flex and grid sometimes this is just the start i will continue to work on it with hard challenge
